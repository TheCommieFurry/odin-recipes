        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Slow Cooker Mojo Chicken</strong> is fall-off-the-bone tender. Allow enough time to marinate the chicken thighs, the longer the better. I serve the thighs over white rice and spoon some sauce over chicken. I also serve additional sauce on the side.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive juice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, pressed</li>
            <li>2 medium oranges, zested</li>
            <li>1 medium lime, zested</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>4 (6oz) bone-in chicken thighs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine orange juice, lime juice, olive oil, cilantro, garlic, orange zest, lime zest, oregano, salt, pepper, cumin, and bay leaves in a large resealable bag. Add chicken thighs, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours or overnight. Flip the bag over occasionally and rub over chicken thighs to evenly distribute marinade.</li>
            <li>Place chicken and marinade in a slow cooker. Cook on Low until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 4 to 5 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
